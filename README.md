## About

A challenge given for members by my organization. 
The task was to built a guessing game with Rust using the discussed topics on the webinar.
This is a FizzBuzz game where you have to answer whether the current number is "fizz", "buzz", "fizzbuzz", or "{int}".

A number is "fizz" if it is divisible by 3.
A number is "buzz" if it is divisible by 5.
A number is "fizzbuzz" if it is divisible by both 3 and 5.
Otherwise, the answer will be the number itself.
